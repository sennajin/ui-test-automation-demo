## üöÄ Next Steps: Phase 2 Implementation

You have **45 remaining tasks** across 5 phases. Here's your recommended path forward:

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2: POMs & Utilities)

**Priority 1: Implement Core Utilities (Sequential - T008-T011)**

These are blocking tasks that all other code depends on:

1. **T008: Define Centralized Selectors** (`tests/utils/selectors.ts`)
   - Define all 11 UI element selectors with fallbacks
   - See: `specs/001-build-an-mvp/spec.md` (Selector Definitions table)
   - Estimated: 1 hour

2. **T009: Implement Selector Utility Functions** (`tests/utils/selectors.ts`)
   - Create `getElement()` function with progressive fallback logic
   - Estimated: 45 minutes

3. **T010: Define Wait Condition Utilities** (`tests/utils/waitConditions.ts`)
   - Implement 6 wait conditions from spec (page load, navigation visible, etc.)
   - See: `specs/001-build-an-mvp/spec.md` (Wait Conditions table)
   - Estimated: 1 hour

4. **T011: Implement Cart Cleanup Utility** (`tests/utils/cleanup.ts`)
   - Idempotent cart cleanup (constitutional requirement - Principle 2)
   - Critical for live store safety
   - Estimated: 1 hour

**Priority 2: Implement Page Object Models (Can be Parallelized - T012-T015)**

Once utilities are complete, these can be built in parallel:

5. **T012: Implement HomePage POM** (`tests/page-objects/HomePage.ts`)
   - Methods: `goto()`, `getBrandTitle()`, `getNavigation()`, `clickCollectionsLink()`
   - See: `specs/001-build-an-mvp/data-model.md` (HomePage section)
   - Estimated: 45 minutes

6. **T013: Implement CollectionPage POM** (`tests/page-objects/CollectionPage.ts`)
   - Methods: `goto()`, `getProductCards()`, `clickProduct()`, `hasProducts()`
   - See: `specs/001-build-an-mvp/data-model.md` (CollectionPage section)
   - Estimated: 1 hour

7. **T014: Implement ProductPage POM** (`tests/page-objects/ProductPage.ts`)
   - Methods: `getTitle()`, `getPrice()`, `getAddToCartButton()`, `clickAddToCart()`
   - See: `specs/001-build-an-mvp/data-model.md` (ProductPage section)
   - Estimated: 45 minutes

8. **T015: Implement CartPage POM** (`tests/page-objects/CartPage.ts`)
   - Methods: `goto()`, `getCartItems()`, `clickRemoveButton()`, `removeAllItems()`, `isEmpty()`
   - See: `specs/001-build-an-mvp/data-model.md` (CartPage section)
   - Estimated: 1 hour

**Phase 2 Checkpoint:**
After completing T008-T015, you should be able to manually navigate pages using POM methods in a Node.js console.

---

### After Phase 2: Test Implementation (Phase 3)

**Test Scenario 1 (TS1): Homepage & Navigation - T016-T020**
- 3 test cases across 4 viewports = 12 test executions
- Target: < 2 minutes total runtime
- Independent (can run alone)

**Test Scenario 2 (TS2): Collection & Product Discovery - T021-T026**
- 4 test cases across 4 viewports = 16 test executions
- Target: < 2.5 minutes total runtime
- Depends on TS1 for navigation

**Test Scenario 3 (TS3): Cart Operations - T027-T032**
- 4 test cases across 4 viewports = 16 test executions
- Target: < 3 minutes total runtime
- Depends on TS2 for product selection

## üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Compliance

**All Phase 1 work aligns with the 8 constitutional principles:**

- ‚úÖ **Principle 1** (Evidence Clarity): HTML reporter configured with screenshots
- ‚úÖ **Principle 2** (Code Quality): TypeScript strict mode, clean structure
- ‚úÖ **Principle 3** (Testing Standards): Viewport matrix, explicit configuration
- ‚úÖ **Principle 4** (UX Consistency): Store URL configured, ready for core flow tests
- ‚úÖ **Principle 5** (Performance): Parallel execution enabled (`fullyParallel: true`)
- ‚úÖ **Principle 6** (Governance): Safe configuration, no checkout/payment setup
- ‚úÖ **Principle 7** (Trade-off Precedence): Safety prioritized (cleanup required before tests)
- ‚úÖ **Principle 8** (Risk Management): .gitignore prevents accidental commits of sensitive data

## üí° Implementation Tips

### Code Examples Available
All tasks (T008-T052) include complete code examples in `tasks.md`. You can copy-paste and adapt as needed.

### Testing Approach
1. **Start with utilities**: Get selectors and wait conditions working first
2. **Build POMs incrementally**: Test each POM method manually before writing tests
3. **One test at a time**: Implement TS1 (homepage) completely before TS2
4. **Validate early**: Run tests frequently (even incomplete ones) to catch issues

### Running Tests During Development
```bash
# List configured tests (even if 0)
npx playwright test --list

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/smoke/homepage.spec.ts

# Run with visible browser for debugging
npx playwright test --headed

# Run one viewport only (faster iteration)
npx playwright test --project=full-hd
```

### Constitutional Reminders
- **Cart cleanup is mandatory**: Every test that modifies cart must clean up in `afterEach`
- **No checkout submissions**: Tests stop before checkout page (constitutional safety)
- **Explicit waits only**: Never use `setTimeout()` or arbitrary delays
- **Selector fallbacks required**: Every element needs primary + fallback selectors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security
- `.env` is git-ignored ‚úÖ
- Never commit credentials or sensitive data
- Store URL is public (safe to commit)

### Live Store Safety (Constitutional Requirement)
- All tests run against live production store: https://prometheamosaic.com/
- **MUST** implement cart cleanup (T011) before cart tests (T027-T032)
- **MUST NOT** proceed past checkout page
- **MUST** use dynamic product selection (no hardcoded IDs)

### Bookmarks Collection Dependency
- Tests assume "Bookmarks" collection exists at `/collections/bookmarks`
- Collection must contain ‚â•1 product
- Verify manually before running tests: https://prometheamosaic.com/collections/bookmarks

---

## üéØ Success Criteria for Phase 2

When Phase 2 is complete, you should be able to:

1. Import and use selector utilities in any file
2. Import and use wait condition utilities in any file
3. Import and instantiate HomePage POM and call its methods
4. Import and instantiate CollectionPage POM and call its methods
5. Import and instantiate ProductPage POM and call its methods
6. Import and instantiate CartPage POM and call its methods
7. Call `cleanupCart()` utility and see cart emptied on live store

**Manual validation test:**
```typescript
// Create a quick test file to verify POMs work
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import { HomePage } from './page-objects/HomePage';

test('manual POM test', async ({ page }) => {
  const homePage = new HomePage(page);
  await homePage.goto();
  const brandTitle = await homePage.getBrandTitle();
  console.log('Brand title found:', await brandTitle.textContent());
});
```
