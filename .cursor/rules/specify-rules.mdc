## Governing Principles

All development must align with the [Project Constitution](../memory/constitution.md):

1. **Priority Hierarchy**: User trust, evidence clarity, sustainable maintenance > feature breadth
2. **Code Quality**: Readable tests, deterministic execution, no residue
3. **Testing Standards**: Stable selectors, explicit waits, data hygiene
4. **UX Consistency**: Core flows verified (pages, navigation, discovery, cart)
5. **Performance**: Fast smoke suite (< 5min), value-proportional runtime
6. **Governance**: Safety > coverage, resilient to content churn, human-readable reports
7. **Trade-off Order**: Safety > Clarity > Reliability > Breadth
8. **Risk Management**: Mitigation + rollback for risky changes

## Commands
# Add commands for 

## Code Style
: Follow standard conventions

**Testing Code Style** (per Constitution Principle 2):
- Test names MUST clearly state intent
- One assertion per logical check
- Explicit waits, never arbitrary sleeps
- Deterministic setup/teardown with cleanup verification
- Stable selectors with documented fallbacks
